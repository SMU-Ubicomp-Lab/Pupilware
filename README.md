# Pupilware Framework

**NOTE: The software is under early development, and only be intended for Pupilware researchers and developers at SMU Ubicomp Lab, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, USA.**

Pupilware Framework is a framework to help researchers to create an algorithm to find pupil size in normal digital images and videos. It is written in C/C++, and using OpenCV as image processing library. Therefore, researchers or developers who familiar with OpenCV library can use the framework like home.
 
All algorithms are based on Pupilware paper by Rafiqi *et al.* 2014. For more details, please refer to the Pupilware paper [here](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7367008&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D7367008).
